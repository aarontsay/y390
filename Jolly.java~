/* A sequence of n > 0 integers is called a jolly jumper if the abs values of the difference between
 * successive elements take on all the values 1 through n-1. For instance,
 * 
 * 1 4 2 3
 * 
 * is a jolly jumper because the absolutes differences are 3, 2, and 1 respectively. The definition
 * implies that any sequence of a single integer is a jolly jumper. Your are to write a program
 * to determine whether or not each of a number of sequences if a jolly jumper. 
 * 
 * Input
 * Each line of input contains an integer n <= 3000 followed by n integers representing the sequence.
 * 
 * Output 
 * For each line of input, generate a line of output saying "Jolly" or "Not jolly".
 * 
 * Sample Input            Sample Output
 * 4: 1 4 2 3 (3 3 2 1)              Jolly
 * 5: 1 4 2 -1 6 (4, 3, 2, 3, 7)            Not Jolly
